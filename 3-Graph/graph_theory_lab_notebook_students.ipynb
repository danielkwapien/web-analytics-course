Lab Introduction\n","\n","- In this lab we will implement different metrics and algorithms we have covered in the theoretical classes.\n","\n","- The lab will be done in groups of 2 people.\n","\n","- The lab defines a set of milestones the students must complete. Upon the completion of every milestone students should call the professor, who will check the correctness of the solution (*If the professor is busy, do not wait for them, move to the next milestone*).\n","\n","- **The final mark will be computed as function of the number of milestones successfully completed.**\n","\n","- **Each group should also share their lab notebook with the professor upon the finalization of the lab.**\n","\n","- In this lab we will use the [NetworkX Phython]( https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/index.html) library for the analysis of graphs and networks. As indicated in the *Lab Preparation* section above, it is expected that students have gained experience in the use of the NetworkX library before starting the first session of the lab.\n","\n","- It is  recommended to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to produce the Python notebook with the solution of the lab. Of course, if any student prefers using its local programming environment (e.g., jupyter) and python installation, they is  welcome to do so. \n","\n","- *Note that most of the milestones consists in the implementation of metrics or algorithms which are already implemented in NetworkX. Hence, before calling the professor for checking the correctness of a milestone, it is highly recommended that students compare the result obtained with their solution and the equivalent function of NetworkX. The results should match. For instance, if a milestone requires to implement the Betweenness Centrality metric, students can check if their implementation of this metric is correct by comparing it with the result offered by the [betweenness centrality](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.betweenness_centrality.html#networkx.algorithms.centrality.betweenness_centrality) from the NetworkX library.*\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fNNnpecv1wbt"},"source":["# MILESTONE 0\n","\n","a) Generate a directed graph with 5 nodes and 6 edges between those nodes.\n","*We recommend you to use the functions add_nodes_from and add_edges_from*\n","\n","b) Plot the resulting graph.
